##### Research profile

I am interested in how observations and theoretical predictions can be combined to understand astrophysical phenomena.  My focus is on the relationship between the extremely dense matter inside of neutron stars, and the extreme gravity that holds these objects together.  Current and future observatories and simulations will provide huge amounts of data about neutron stars, but extracting observables is a challenge due to many extremly complicated interconnected phenomena which shape how we see them.  

I help to develop hydrodynamic simulations for the next-generation
