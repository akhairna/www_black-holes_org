##### Research Projects

I am interested in compact objects such as neutron stars and black holes and high-energy phenomena related to these objects. I am currently working on the generation and evolution of large-scale dynamos in compact objects. I am also curious about how to bridge these electromagnetic activities to multi-messenger astronomical signals.

##### Biography

I received a BS in physics from Nanjing University in 2023.
Now I am a graduate student in physics at Caltech.
