##### Research Projects

Mergers of black holes and neutron stars in binaries; Long term evolution of accretion disks

##### Biography

I am currently an Einstein post-doctoral fellow at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBL), where I
work mainly in numerical relativity as a member of the SXS collaboration. My research involves
studying mergers of compact objects (black holes and neutron stars) through numerical simulations in
general relativity, as well as the long term evolution of accretion disks.

I obtained engineering degrees from both the Free University of Brussels (ULB) and the Ecole
Centrale Paris (ECP) in 2005, before moving to the United States for my PhD. I graduated from
Cornell in 2011. I then worked for 3 years as a post-doctoral fellow at the Canadian Institute for
Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA) in Toronto.
